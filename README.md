# Customer Churn Prediction in a Retail Store

## Overview
This data science project focuses on predicting customer churn in a retail store using data provided by CSSA IUST as part of the Data Science Crash Course. The dataset includes information for 1500+ customers, including the day and the corresponding purchase amount. The primary goal is to identify customers who are more likely to leave the store and provide insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Project Structure

- **Data:** The dataset includes 1500+ files which are each for a unique customer and are placed in `Data` folder.

- **Code:** The code directory includes Python scripts for performing exploratory data analysis, customer churn prediction, and visualization.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Customer Data
- Visualized customer spending patterns over time.
- Explored behaviour of customers.
- Investigated the distribution of purchase amounts and identified outliers.

### Store Data
- Analyzed store-related features, such as special events.
- Investigated the impact of store events on customer transactions.

## Churn Prediction

- Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn using clustering method.
- Utilized features derived from the EDA process.
- Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into customer behavior within the retail store. The exploratory data analysis sheds light on patterns and trends, while the churn prediction model offers a proactive approach to identify customers at risk of leaving. By understanding these dynamics, the store can take targeted actions to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.
